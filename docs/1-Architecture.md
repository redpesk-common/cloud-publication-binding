# redpeskÂ® Cloud Publication Binding

## 1. Introduction

The cloud publication binding allows to selectively publish target signal data
to the cloud with proper link quality handling. When the cloud side disconnects,
the binding running on the target will pend and resume publication when the link
is up again.

The binding also offers the ability to select which sensor data is published via
its config file.

## 2. Architecture

The cloud publication binding relies on Redis binding (`redis-tsdb-binding`) on
both the cloud and target sides. It reads from the target Redis database using
`redis-tsdb-binding` and writes to the cloud side also using the same binding
this time running in the cloud.
